# DecisionParalysis
  
This Python script generates a weekend itinerary consisting of activities for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. The activities are categorized into exercise, chore, and leisure. The script randomly selects one exercise activity, two chore activities, and two leisure activities for each day and combines them into a full itinerary.
